## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. tkinter Not Found
**Problem**: `ImportError: No module named 'tkinter'`
**Solution**:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install tkinter
# or
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# macOS (if using Homebrew)
brew install python-tk
```

#### 2. Code Execution Errors
**Problem**: User code throws exceptions
**Solution**: The game handles exceptions gracefully and displays error messages in the results tab. Check your code syntax and logic.

#### 3. Display Issues
**Problem**: GUI elements appear incorrectly
**Solution**: Ensure your system supports the required screen resolution (minimum 1000x700). Update your display drivers if necessary.

#### 4. Performance Issues
**Problem**: Game runs slowly
**Solution**: Close other applications to free up system resources. The game is optimized for modern systems but may run slower on older hardware.

## Extending the Game

### Adding New Cases
To add new mystery cases, extend the `self.cases` list in the `__init__` method:

```python
new_case = {
    "title": "Your Mystery Title",
    "description": "Detailed case description",
    "concept": "Python Concept Being Taught",
    "data": your_case_data,               # Evidence/data structure
    "clues": ["Clue 1", "Clue 2", ...],  # Investigation hints
    "solution_code": "# Expert solution code",
    "hint": "Helpful hint for players"
}
self.cases.append(new_case)
```

### Customizing Difficulty
Modify case complexity by:
- Adjusting data structure complexity
- Changing the number of clues provided
- Varying the algorithmic requirements
- Adding red herrings or misleading information

### Enhancing UI
The modular design allows easy UI improvements:
- Add syntax highlighting to the code editor
- Implement auto-completion features
- Create custom themes and color schemes
- Add sound effects and animations
